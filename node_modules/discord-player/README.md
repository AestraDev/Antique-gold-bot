## Getting Started

Here is the code you will need to get started with discord-player. Then, you will be able to use `client.player` everywhere in your code!

```js
const Discord = require("discord.js"),
client = new Discord.Client,
settings = {
    prefix: "!",
    token: "Your Discord Token"
};

const { Player } = require("discord-player");

// Create a new Player (you don't need any API Key)
const player = new Player(client);

// To easily access the player
client.player = player;

// add the trackStart event so when a song will be played this message will be sent
client.player.on("trackStart", (message, track) => message.channel.send(`Now playing ${track.title}...`))

client.once("ready", () => {
    console.log("I'm ready !");
});

client.on("message", async (message) => {

    const args = message.content.slice(settings.prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/g);
    const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();

    // !play Despacito
    // will play "Despacito" in the voice channel
    if(command === "play"){
        client.player.play(message, args[0]);
        // as we registered the event above, no need to send a success message here
    }

});

client.login(settings.token);
```

## Supported websites

By default, discord-player supports **YouTube**, **Spotify** and **SoundCloud** streams only.

### Optional dependencies

Discord Player provides an **Extractor API** that enables you to use your custom stream extractor with it. Some packages have been made by the community to add new features using this API.

#### [@discord-player/extractor](https://github.com/Snowflake107/discord-player-extractors) (optional)

Optional package that adds support for `vimeo`, `reverbnation`, `facebook`, `attachment links` and `lyrics`.
You just need to install it using `npm i --save @discord-player/extractor` (discord-player will automatically detect and use it).

#### [@discord-player/downloader](https://github.com/DevSnowflake/discord-player-downloader) (optional)

`@discord-player/downloader` is an optional package that brings support for +700 websites. The documentation is available [here](https://github.com/DevSnowflake/discord-player-downloader).
